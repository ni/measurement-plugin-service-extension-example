Contributions to Measurement Plug-In Service Extension Example are welcome from all!

Measurement Plug-In Service Extension Example is managed via [git](https://git-scm.com), with the canonical upstream
repository hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/ni/<reponame>/).

Measurement Plug-In Service Extension Example follows a pull-request model for development.  If you wish to
contribute, you will need to create a GitHub account, fork this project, push a
branch with your changes to your project, and then submit a pull request.

Please remember to sign off your commits (e.g., by using `git commit -s` if you
are using the command line client). This amends your git commit message with a line
of the form `Signed-off-by: Name Lastname <name.lastmail@emailaddress.com>`. Please
include all authors of any given commit into the commit message with a
`Signed-off-by` line. This indicates that you have read and signed the Developer
Certificate of Origin (see below) and are able to legally submit your code to
this repository.

See [GitHub's official documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for more details.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- (Optional) Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
- Install Git.
- Install Python and add it to the `PATH`.
- Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Version >= 1.8.2

## Clone or Update the Git Repository

To download the Measurement Plug-In Integration Example for Python source, clone its Git
repository to your local PC.

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ni/measurement-plugin-service-extension-example.git
```

If you already have the Git repository on your local PC, you can update it

```cmd
git checkout main

git pull
```

## Install the Dependencies

From the package's subdirectory, run the [`poetry install`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#install)
command. This creates an in-project virtual environment (`.venv`) and installs
the package's dependencies and dev-dependencies, as specified in its
`pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` files.

```cmd
poetry install
```

## Activate the Virtual Environment (If Needed)

- In the command prompt: `poetry shell`
- In VS Code ([link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_select-and-activate-an-environment))

## Steps to Contribute

To contribute to this project, it is recommended that you follow these steps:

1. Make your change.
2. Send a GitHub Pull Request to the main repository's master branch. GitHub
   Pull Requests are the expected method of code collaboration on this project.

# Lint and Build Code

## Lint Code for Style and Formatting

Use [ni-python-styleguide](https://github.com/ni/python-styleguide) to lint the
code for style and formatting. This runs other tools such as `flake8`,
`pycodestyle`, and `black`.

```cmd
poetry run ni-python-styleguide lint
```

If there are any failures, try using `ni-python-styleguide` to fix them, then
lint the code again. If `ni-python-styleguide` doesn't fix the failures, you
will have to manually fix them.

```cmd
poetry run ni-python-styleguide fix
poetry run ni-python-styleguide lint
```

## Mypy Type Checking

Use [Mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/) to type check the code.

```cmd
poetry run mypy src
```

## Bandit Security Checks

Use [Bandit](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/) to check for common security issues.

```cmd
poetry run bandit -c pyproject.toml -r src
```

# Adding Dependencies

You can add new dependencies using `poetry add` or by editing the `pyproject.toml` file.

When adding new dependencies, use a `>=` version constraint (instead of `^`)
unless the dependency uses semantic versioning.
